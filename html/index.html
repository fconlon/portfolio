              Hello my name is Frank Conlon. I created this page both as a place for me to practice web
              development and as a portfolio of things that I have done. I hope this gives me an opportunity
              to share a bit about myself and demonstrate my work.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px">
              I am a 36 year full stack developer at. I was previously an instructer at Texas Tech
              Unviversity where I taught introductory Computer Science courses as well as Data Structures, Software
              Engineering, Assembly Language, and Logic programming.  I have also Served
              as an Amunition Sergeant in the United States Army and I am a disabled combat
              Veteran. Other places that I have worked include Texas Instruments and Sandia
              National Labs, USAA, BrieBug, and OneBrief. At Texas instruments I worked on FAB automation as an intern and
              at Sandia I worked on several projects as a research intern. At USAA, BrieBug and OneBrief I worked
	      as a full stack developer. My fronted experience is primarly with React both using Typescript and native 
	      javascript. My backend experience is primarly with Java using Java EE and/or Spring Boot, but I have
	      also worked with servers develope using Express.

              <h2>About This Website</h2>
            </div>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px">
              This website is hosted on my personal computer in my personal home. I built the computer myself 
              with a 16 core processor and 64 GB of memory to handle (admitedly limited) traffic. The front end 
              is developed with varying technologies (React Bootstrap, Django templating etc). The variety is due to the 
              fact that I use this platform as a test bed to teach myself different technologies. The backend 
              of this sever uses NGINX and Django to serve content with a Sqlite database. I am also familiar 
              with the Apache, PHP, MySql paradigm as well. I recently set up my own gitlab server and am in the
              process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster on this machine to automate deployment and testing of new
              content straight from the CI/CD pipeline. I also run a mail server on this machine (I just wanted to
              learn how to do it), but I don't actually use it for my own personal email.
            </p>

              <h2>Titanic Disaster Visualization</h2>
            </div>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px">
              This app uses the Aframe javascript library to provide a Virtual Reality visualization of
              the survivor data from the titanic disaster. Clicking on any cylinder will apply a filter to
              the data and adjust the heights of all of the cylinders in the visualization. For example,
              clicking on the cylinder labeled "Died" will filter the data to show only the passengers that
              died in the disaster. Clicking the cylinder a second time will remove the filter from the data.
	      You can also move around using the wasd keys and rotate the camera by clicking the viewscreen
	      and moving the mouse.

            <p style="text-indent: 20px">
              This app is built on reactjs and django. I created it to keep track of the allowance that I gave my children. Feel free to use 
              it yourself or just play around. There are 2 known issues that I just haven't had spare time to fix. When a parent first logs 
              in and does not have a child registered there is an error related to the tables library that I am using. It doesn't like that there 
              is no data for the table. It is safe to ignore this error. Also, the user must manually refresh any time data is changed (add/remove
              child, update balances etc). I had intentions to fix this, but my wife found another tool that she decided to use *sadface*.

              password is "djangoisfun". The database is regularly reset once a week so the changes
              will not be permanent, but you can post a question and see how the polls app is affected.
